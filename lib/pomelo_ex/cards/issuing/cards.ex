  Considerations
    - The extend parameter is used to obtain additional data from a card, and to use it, you must have a valid and current PCI-DSS certification, backed by the ROC report. If you do not have the certification, follow the steps in [this documentation](https://docs.pomelo.la/en/docs/cards/issuing/sensitive-information).
    - If you have contracted dynamic CVV, you will see the cvv_expiration_time field that determines the validity of the new code. Learn more about [dynamic CVV](https://docs.pomelo.la/en/docs/cards/issuing/dynamic-cvv).
